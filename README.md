# UserManagement_Excel_Add-in

This is Excel Add-in project in .NET, here I have created a usermanagement tab and two buttons called data and search.

Functionalities :

1. Data Button : a) For a given id checks if data present in database table or not.
                 b) If the data is present in DB then populates it in form and shows status as 'Exists'.
                 c) If the data is not present in DB then shows status as 'New'.
                 d) You can edit the data if status is 'Exists'.
                 e) You can add new data if status is 'New'.
               
2. Search Button : a) You have to enter first name or initials of the first name to fetch records of all users.
                   b) The data will be showns as grid view.
